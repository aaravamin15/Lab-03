Welcome to our preliminary Endpoints for oour final project. Below is our progress report as of now:

- We have set up the database system for retrieving and adding IDs and AudioData
- We found a way to record audio files directly into the database using node-record-lpcm16 and slot it into the database as a BLOB, or BINARY LARGE OBJECT.
